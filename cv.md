## About me
After trying myself in various spheres, I discovered my love for IT. What fascinates me the most about IT is the opportunity to _constantly develop_ and to _learn something new_ every day. I enjoy well-structured code and user-friendly interfaces.  
In January 2022 I tried to learn different programming languages on my own, and in the process I realized that I would like to become a frontend developer.
Since August 2022 till September 2023 I studied Frontend Development and had an internship in this area at HTML Academy and I successfully completed the workshop and defended the graduation projects. I acquired strong knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Now I'm interning as a frontend developer at Liga A.  
I continue to study above-mentioned areas and in future I would like to learn React and Vue.js.

## Languages and Tools
- HTML;
- CSS;
- Sass;
- JavaScript;
- Gulp;
- Git, Github;
- BEM methodology;
- working with different libraries, e.g. swiper, pristine;
- Figma.

## Code Example
**Task description:** _Write a function that converts any sentence into a V A P O R W A V E sentence; a V A P O R W A V E sentence converts all the letters into uppercase, and adds 2 spaces between each letter (or special character) to create this V A P O R W A V E effect.
Note that spaces should be ignored in this case._

```

const vaporcode = (string) => string.replace(/\s/g,'').toUpperCase().split('').join('  ');

```
